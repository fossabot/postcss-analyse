## Continuous Integration

Provided by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dbtedman/postcss-analyse/actions?workflow=Test), run on every commit and pull request.

## Code Formatting

Code formatting support provided by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

```bash
yarn format

## Test

Tested using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), using test cases defined in the `src/` directory matching `*.spec.ts` pattern.

```bash
yarn test
```

## Publishing

> You need to first be logged in to NPM to publish. Try `yarn login` first and if that does not work when running the below commands, try `npm login` instead.

After updating the current version, run the following command:

```bash
yarn release
```

You can test what will be published by running the following command:

```bash
yarn pack
```
